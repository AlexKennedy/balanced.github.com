As an online marketplace, you're responsible for submitting 1099-misc 
forms to the IRS for any sub-contractors that makes more than $600 a year
on your platform.

As a payment processor, [Balanced](http://balancedpayments.com) is responsible for reporting 1099-K forms to the 
IRS and the merchants selling goods or services on our marketplace partners platforms,
but only when they make more than $20,000 from 200+ transactions in a year.

[Requirements for reporting 1099-misc](http://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099msc/ar02.html#d0e931):
- What is nonemployee compensation?   If the following four conditions are met, you must generally report a payment as nonemployee compensation.
- You made the payment to someone who is not your employee;
- You made the payment for services in the course of your trade or business (including government agencies and nonprofit organizations);
- You made the payment to an individual, partnership, estate, or, in some cases, a corporation; and
- You made payments to the payee of at least $600 during  the year.

[Requirements for reporting 1099-K](http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/New-1099-K-Reporting-Requirements-for-Payment-Settlement-Entities):
Beginning in January, 2012, payment settlement entities (PSEs) are required by the Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008 to report on Form 1099-K the following transactions:
Payments in settlement of third party network transactions IF:
- Gross payments to a participating payee exceed $20,000; AND
- There are more than 200 transactions with the participating payee.

I wanted to bring this up since it's January and many of you are filing your tax form this month. How are you filing your 1099 forms this year?
