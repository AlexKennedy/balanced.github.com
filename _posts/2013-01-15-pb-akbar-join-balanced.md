Today, we're happy to announce that the Balanced team is getting a little bit bigger: 

#### Balanced Hires Former Eventbrite & PayPal Exec. as Head of Operations

[Patrick Breitenbach](http://www.linkedin.com/in/pbreitenbach), former Director of Operations at [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com), has joined Balanced as our 11th team member and VP Operations. 

Patrick -- aka PB -- will build out Balanced's support operations, lead vendor/banking relationships, and establish the regulatory architecture behind our upcoming international expansion. This is great news for all you current and future Balanced customers [waiting for us to expand to Canada and abroad](https://github.com/balanced/balanced-api/issues/2).

PB was critical to Eventbrite's recent European expansion, and managed merchant services at PayPal for several years before that, so he's no stranger to establishing and running successful payments and support divisions. PB started off as an investor and advisor to Balanced, but we're delighted to have him onboard full-time! Here's Patrick on [why he invested in Balanced](http://www.quora.com/Balanced/Why-did-you-invest-in-Balanced/answer/Patrick-Breitenbach).

#### Airbnb's Former Head of Payments Joins Balanced's Board
We're also happy to announce that [Akbar Thobhani](http://www.linkedin.com/in/akbart) has joined Balanced's board. Akbar previously served as Airbnb's Head of Payments, and the Director of Product Management at [BOKU](http://www.boku.com/), an international mobile payments company. 

We're grateful to be able to add such talented people to our family, and look forward to a wonderful 2013. 

Happy payments!
